# apps-videoplayer
A small desktop video player example application implemented in Objective-C and built with GNUstep/Gorm.

This repository contains the source, interface definition, and build files for a simple VideoPlayer demo app. It's intended as an example or starting point for building GNUStep/Cocoa-style desktop apps that present a GUI (designed with Gorm) and provide basic video playback functionality.

## Features

- Objective-C source for app controller and main entry point (`AppController.h/.m`, `VideoPlayer_main.m`).
- Gorm UI resources in `Resources/VideoPlayer.gorm` (interface builder files generated by Gorm).
- GNUstep-style build using the included `GNUmakefile`.

## Requirements

- GNUstep toolchain (gnustep-make, gnustep-base, gnustep-gui). On macOS you can install GNUstep via Homebrew or your package manager.
- A working video backend / codecs on your system. Playback relies on whatever multimedia frameworks are available to the platform; if some formats fail you may need to install additional codec support (ffmpeg, GStreamer, etc.).

## Build & Run (macOS / Unix with GNUstep)

1. Install GNUstep (follow the official instructions at https://www.gnustep.org/).
2. Source the GNUstep environment script from your installation so make knows where to find GNUstep makefiles. Common locations include:

```zsh
# Example (Intel Homebrew or packaged GNUstep)
source /usr/local/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

# Example (Homebrew on Apple Silicon may place packages under /opt/homebrew)
# source /opt/homebrew/opt/gnustep-make/libexec/gnustep-make/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
```

3. Build the project:

```zsh
make
```

4. Run the app. Depending on the makefile and platform this repository may build an application bundle (e.g. `VideoPlayer.app`) or a runnable binary. Try one of:

```zsh
# If an .app bundle was created
gopen ./VideoPlayer.app

# Or run the binary produced by the build (if present)
./VideoPlayer.app/VideoPlayer
```

If `make` fails, inspect the GNUmakefile output for missing GNUstep dependencies or incorrect GNUstep environment setup.

## Project layout

- `AppController.h` / `AppController.m` — main Objective-C class that manages the user interface and player logic.
- `VideoPlayer_main.m` — application entry point (main).
- `Resources/VideoPlayer.gorm/` — Gorm (Interface Builder) files describing windows and UI objects.
- `VideoPlayerInfo.plist` — application info property list.
- `GNUmakefile`, `GNUmakefile.preamble`, `GNUmakefile.postamble` — GNUstep build files used by `make`.
- `VideoPlayer.pcproj/` — ProjectCenter project metadata (optional, for editing in ProjectCenter).

## Troubleshooting

- "Undefined symbols" or missing headers during build: ensure you sourced the correct `GNUstep.sh` and installed `gnustep-make`, `gnustep-base` and `gnustep-gui`.
- App launches but video won't play: confirm your system has appropriate codecs. Try installing `ffmpeg` or a GStreamer backend if available for your platform.
- If the UI doesn't appear correctly, open `Resources/VideoPlayer.gorm` with Gorm or inspect `AppController.m` to see how UI objects are connected.
